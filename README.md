## A funtional website named kids store  

This project was built along with a fully functioning photo gallery.Every code in this project are fully funtional and responsive, between search, home and contact us. To pickup,returns and delivery. Clothing, Toys and Nursery all have content in it. The website consist of 3 pages namely: index, templet and staffs which contains 2 tables: The customer and shop assistant

* Styling inspiration from webflow. 
* Kept my html files outside of a folder after a failed attempt of putting them in a folder as adviced in my previous project. html files failed to respond due to the fact that html cannot see any file when it is outside of root web.
* Had a lot of difficulties with photo gallery.one minute is fully responsive the next is not.
* Got some inspiration on website from Mammas and Papas ireland.
* Inspirations on refunds and shipping came from Diesel.ie.
* Photos were uploaded off SHEIN, Ickle bubba, Amazon and Smyths.
* staffs.html is'nt connected to the main website, because only shop assistant can access it not customers.
